# AutoBackup
Automatically backs up data from multiple locations and stores it at a particular location in a folder of current date and time. 
The locations of the backup source can be entered in a .csv file.
This product was made to automate the redundant jobs of collecting backup from multiple sites/users in a locally connected workplace, where backups are taken in a pendrive manually.
